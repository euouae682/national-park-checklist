# National Park Checklist

## Description

This project is a web application meant to function as an interactive and in-depth checklist for national parks (and other parks).
Along with including simple CRUD operations, it will also include the ability to show statistics about a user's checklist and park-specific info for supported sites.
There will also be the ability to separate and organize parks into sections and allow for in-depth personalization.

NOTE: The project is currently in a very primitive form, so functionality and documentation is limited.
